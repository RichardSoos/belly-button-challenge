# Javascript Module 14 challenge Microbe biodiversity in belly buttons
# Using javascript and an associated html file we created an interactive dashboard.
# The dataset provided by the department of ecology is also provided as a sample 
# file that I have included. They may be obtained from the source:
# http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/results-and-data/
# The study finds that 8 species of bacteria are found to dominate in 
# representation of navels of subjects. There is no signifier of location, race, 
# age or hygeine according to the study. However, this was beyond the exercise
# purpose. Our task was simply to create an interactive visualisation of bacteria # samples per individual subject.
#
# Program execution: in your chrome browser with extensions enabled, drag the html # file 'index.html' to the address bar. Your mouse will enable you to change the 
# subject id to see a bar and bubble graph of bacteria count by Operation 
# Taxanomic Unit (bacteria type). Ametadata panel will also appear with human test 
# subject data
